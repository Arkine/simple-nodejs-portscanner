# NodeJS Port Scanner
A simple nodejs implementation of a port scanner.

This was just another exploration to see if it was possible and what the differences were compared to a python port scanner.

## Usage
```
Options:
-h : Host Name (ex: nmap.com)
-s : Start Port
-e : End Port
-t : timeout (defaults to 2000)
------------------------------------------

$ node scanner.js -h <hostname> -s <startPort> -e <endPort>
```
